LuceneIndex-idd
Write a Java program that indexes .txt files in a directory on your laptop. 
Specifically, two fields should be considered (and two indices created): the file name and the file content. Use an appropriate analyzer for each field.

Write a Java program that reads a query from the console, queries the index, and prints the result. 
Use a simple query syntax (for example, a query starts with the keywords 'name' or 'content' followed by a sequence of terms, possibly enclosed in quotes to express a phrase query).
